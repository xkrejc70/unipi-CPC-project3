CPC - Competitive Programming and Contests - Project: Dynamic Programming

# Hands-on #03
## Dynamic Programming
In this hands-on, we are going to solve two problems with Dynamic Programming.
For each problem, we have a pdf with the description of the problem and a set of tests to check the correctness of your implementations.

- Problem *Holyday planning*: [Text](./problem_01/text.pdf) and [TestSet.zip](./problem_01/Testset.zip)
- Problem *Xmas Lights*: [Text](./problem_02/text.pdf) and [TestSet.zip](./problem_02/Testset.zip). If your are not able to solve this problem, do your best and write on the report all your progresses.

# Submission
Submit 
- a file ```lib.rs``` and a ```main.rs``` for each problem
- a file ```Handson_03_solution_YOUR_NAME.pdf``` to [rossano.venturini@gmail.com](mailto:rossano.venturini@gmail.com) 
by 23/12/2022. 

- Source code ```lib.rs``` contains your solutions.
- The ```main.rs``` file takes its input from stdin and produces its output to the stdout. This way we can use ```./solution < input1.txt | diff - output1.txt``` to compare its output with the expected one on the first test case.
- A report ```Handson_03_solution_YOUR_NAME.pdf``` that briefly describes your solutions, your implementations, and an analysis of their time and space complexities. Add references to 
any relevant source you consulted to find your solutions or to develop their implementations. 

Before submitting your solutions, 
- make sure your implementation successfully passes all the tests.
- use ```cargo fmt``` to format your code. 
- use ```cargo clippy``` to check your code.
- use [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) to improve your English and avoid [tpyos](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tpyo#English) :-). There is an [extension for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=znck.grammarly).  

## Cheating
**Very important!** You are allowed to discuss possible solutions with other
students, **BUT** you have to implement all the solutions by yourself. 
Thus, sharing implementations with others is strictly **forbidden**.
